    "Not writing enough tests is almost always a bad idea. It is very important to build an engineering culture where\n",
    "developers think about writing tests as much as they think about writing code. The second point is even more important. Legacy systems are usually very difficult to manage. When you are working on code written either by someone else or a large distributed team, it is fairly easy to introduce bugs and break things. As you won't have the confidence in the changes that you are making (because there are no test cases to confirm your changes), your code releases will be shaky, slow, and obviously full of hidden bugs."

    "Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. https://jasmine.github.io/ and https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/node.html. Though Jasmine is the most prominent JavaScript testing framework, Mocha and Chai are gaining prominence in the Node.js environment. Mocha is the testing framework used to describe and run test cases.\n",
    "Chai is the assertion library supported by Mocha. Sinon.JS comes in handy while creating mocks and stubs for your tests. We won't discuss these frameworks in this book, but experience on Jasmine will be handy if you want to experiment with these frameworks."

    "## Use Strict\n",
    "We briefly discussed the strict mode in earlier chapters. The strict mode in JavaScript flags or eliminates some of the JavaScript silent errors. Rather than silently failing, the strict mode makes these failures throw errors instead. The strict mode also helps in converting mistakes to actual errors. There are two ways of enforcing the strict mode. If you want the strict mode for the entire script, you can just add the use strict statement as the first line of your JavaScript program. If you want a specific function to conform with the strict mode, you can add the directive as the first line of a function."
